# worklog.el - timetracking mode for Emacs

Worklog is an Emacs major mode which enables you to keep track of what
    you do. It transforms a simple list of timestamps and tasks into a
    summary.
    
An example worklog file:

> 2003-07-2217:20 login 
> 2003-07-22 18:33 Hacking on worklog 
> 2003-07-22 20:00 logout
> 2003-07-23 06:44 login
> 2003-07-23 06:44 Website redesign
> 2003-07-23 07:07 logout

and the resulting summary:

> Generated by Worklog 2.4.2
> 
> Generated on 2004-01-22 at 19:54
> Reporting on 2003-07-22 to 2003-07-23
